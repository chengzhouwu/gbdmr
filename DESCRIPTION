Description: gbdmr is used to identify the differential methylated CpG regions for the microarray data. The method can be smoothly conducted in three steps. First, order the CpG sites based on the chromosome number and chromosome coordinates; calculate the adjacent CpG sitesâ€™ correlation in the same chromosome one by one; get the clustered CpG sites that share similar information based on the correlation and treat these clusters as candidate DMRs. Then generalized beta regression is used to model the CpG sites in the same cluster; parameter estimation is performed via the maximum likelihood function (ML). Finally, conduct a log likelihood ratio test to the interesting phenotype after adjusting for the confounders, then summarize the result and report the DMRs. The method can be used to find the risk CpG sites related to any disease or CpG sites that can be potential mediators in the causal inference.
